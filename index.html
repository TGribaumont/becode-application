                <h3>Job Yourself</h3>
                <p>
                    Job Yourself is an organism that helps people to launch their projects of becoming self employed.
                    If you have a good project, the skills and the experience required to be effective and successful, they are the perfect partner.
                </p>
                <p>The first step is to present your project and to convince them you are able to build it and develop it into a viable activity.</p>
                <p>
                    Once your project is validated, the collaboration begins. During a period of maximum 6 months, you build your project.
                    Business plan, administrative steps, financial plan, prospecting... Everything you need to build a strong project and give you the best chance to be successful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As soon as you and Job Yourself think your project is ready, the second phase starts. This phase is the real test.
                    During this step, you work as you actually would if you were on your own. Production, prospecting, selling, billing...
                    Job Yourself still helps you and you get coaching and help for book-keeping. You are still registered as unemployed and you are then still on the dole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your project is, in the end, not viable, the collaboration ends and you return to a more classical unemployment.
                    This allows you to build a project, to launch it and verify it is viable without taking huge financial risks.

                <h3>Web development</h3>
                <p>
                    During my first training course in web development in learned all the tools necessary to be efficient as a web developer.
                    I learned CSS3, HTML5, the basics of PHP, JavaScript and JQuery.
                    I also learned to create and manage a database with MySQL.
                </p>
                <h3>Java developer</h3>
                <p>
                    My second training course was to become a Java developer. I learned the language itself as well as some useful related tools.
                    I learned the framework Spring, Hibernate, Maven, JPA and Git.
                </p>
                <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to this, I learned the basics of Photoshop. I wanted a tool to help me create original and visual resumes.

                    I would like to go deeper into Javascript. I want to learn node.js and Angular.
                    <!--I would also like to be more familiar with some CSS3 features.-->
                    I have made the online course in SASS on <a href="www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank">www.codeacademy.com</a> and I would like to learn LESS as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as Java development is concerned, I bought several online courses on <a href="www.udemy.com" target="_blank">www.udemy.com</a>.
                    The idea is to know some more advanced features in Java and to further study some related tools.
                    In addition to Java, I chose a course in Angular which seems very important in the job market.

                    In order for my dream to be complete, there is one aspect I would like to offer in my services.
                    That is what I call the graphical identity. The creation of a logo, the choice of the typography, of the colors...
                    I could design business cards, loyalty cards as well.
                    That part of my dream job is not mandatory for it to be successful but it is something that really interests me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two tools that I would really need are Photoshop and Illustrator. I can already create very simple projects with Photoshop but I need to know much more.
                    Also, I should learn to draw to be able to design more original and creative logos.

                            It would probably be my greatest hack. Turning a period of unemployment into the first step towards my dream.
                            In addition to attending training course at BeCode, I will be working on several development projects.

                            Thanks to BeCode, I will have the opportunity to work as an intern at the end of the training course.

                    <p>
                        It is almost impossible for me to talk about me without mentioning basketball.
                        It has been my number one passion for many many years. And I love different aspects of it.
                        I have been playing in the same team for more than 15 years. I am also a real NBA fan.
                        I watch a lot a NBA games and I buy myself an NBA videogame every year.

                    <p>
                        In the beginning, I wanted to open a basketball shop. Therefore, I chose to get a degree in marketing at EPHEC.
                        In the third year of the degree, you get to choose an option and I chose creation and management of SMEs.
                        I love basketball shoes and jerseys and it would have been a good opportunity to combine my work and my passion.
                        Considering the financial risks and the fact that a friend of mine opened a basketball shop during the last year of my degree I abandoned the idea.

                    <p>
                        I love sports in general. I used to play football when I was younger and I am still very interested in it.
                        I also played table tennis and was a member of an aikido club.
                        I really enjoy watching important competitions and events such as the Olympics or the superbowl.

                    <p>
                        My best friend who is a web developer suggested me to look into web development knowing that I was looking to redirect my career.
                        I started with small online courses and I decided to attend a real training course in web development.
                        After this six months training course, I worked 10 months as a web developer junior at Glucone, a small web agency in Brussels.
                        Since I still needed more skills, I attended a training course to become Java developer at Business training.

                    <p>
                        In addition to sports, I really love music. As it has been a dream of mine for years, I recently started to learn to play the piano.
